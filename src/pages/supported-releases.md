# Supported Releases

This page lists the status, timeline and policies for currently supported releases.

:::info

## TL;DR

Each release is supported for a period of **six months**, and we create a new release **every three months**.

:::

## Naming Scheme

Our naming scheme mostly follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with `v` prepended to git tags and docker images:

```plain
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

where `<minor>` is increased for each release, and `<patch>` counts the number of patches for the current `<minor>` release. A patch is usually a small change relative to the `<minor>` release.

## Support Status of Chaos Mesh

:::note

Support for kubernetes `1.22` is available starting with version `2.0.4`.

## Upcoming Releases

You could track the upcoming release on [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/milestones).

## Support Policies

Our support window is **six months** for each release branch. The support window corresponds to the **two latest releases**, given that we produce a new final release **every three months**.

For this we offer two type of supports:

- [Community technical support](#community-technical-support)
- [Security and bug fixes](#security-and-bug-fixes)

### Community technical support

You can request support from the community on CNCF Slack (in the [#project-chaos-mesh](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0193VAV272) channel), or using the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/discussions).

### Security and bug fixes

Security issues are fixed as soon as possible. They get back-ported to the last two releases, and a new patch release is immediately created for them.

For enhancements or bugfixes, we would make a new patch release as required.

## How we determine supported Kubernetes versions

After testing the compatibility of various versions of Kubernetes clusters through E2E testing, the Chaos Mesh team determines [Supported Status of Chaos Mesh](#support-status-of-chaos-mesh) based on its test results.

Below are Kubernetes versions covered by each version of the E2E tests:

| Version | Tested kubernetes Versions |
| :------ | :------------------------- |
| master  | 1.20, 1.23, 1.25           |
| 2.6     | 1.20, 1.23, 1.25           |
| 2.5     | 1.20, 1.23, 1.25           |
| 2.4     | 1.20, 1.23, 1.25           |
