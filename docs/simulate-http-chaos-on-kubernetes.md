This document describes how to simulate HTTP faults by creating HTTPChaos experiments in Chaos Mesh.

## HTTPChaos introduction

HTTPChaos is a fault type provided by Chaos Mesh. By creating HTTPChaos experiments, you can simulate the fault scenarios of the HTTP server during the HTTP request and response processing. Currently, HTTPChaos supports simulating the following fault types:

- `abort`: interrupts server connection.
- `delay`: injects latency into the target process.
- `replace`: replaces part of content in HTTP request or response messages.
- `patch`: adds additional content to HTTP request or response messages.

HTTPChaos supports combinations of different fault types. If you have configured multiple HTTP fault types at the same time when creating HTTPChaos experiments, the order set to inject the faults when the experiments start running is `abort` -> `delay` -> `replace` -> `patch`. When the `abort` fault cause short circuits, the connection will be directly interrupted.

For the detailed description of HTTPChaos configuration, see [Field description](#Field-description) below.

## Notes

Before injecting the faults supported by HTTPChaos, note the followings:

- There is no control manager of Chaos Mesh running on the target Pod.
- For HTTPChaos injection to take effect, the client should avoid reusing TCP socket. This is because HTTPChaos does not affect the HTTP requests that are sent via TCP socket before the fault injection.
- Use non-idempotent requests (such as most of the POST requests) with caution in production environments. If such requests are used, the target service may not return to normal status by repeating requests after the fault injection.

## Create experiments

Currently, Chaos Mesh only supports using YAML configuration files to create HTTPChaos experiments. In the YAML files, you can simulate either one HTTP fault type or a comination of different HTTP fault types.

### Example of `abort`

1. Write the experimental configuration to the `http-abort-failure.yaml` file as the example below：

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPChaos
metadata:
  name: test-http-chaos
spec:
  mode: all
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      app: nginx
  target: Request
  port: 80
  method: GET
  path: /api
  abort: true
  duration: 5m
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 10m'
```

Based on this configuration example, every 10 minutes, Chaos Mesh will inject the `abort` fault into the specified pod for 5 minutes. During the fault injection, the GET requests sent through port 80 in the `/api` path of the target Pod will be interrupted.

2. After the configuration file is prepared, use `kubectl` to create the experiment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./http-abort-failure.yaml
```

### Example of fault combinations

1. Write the experimental configuration to `http-failure.yaml` file as the example below：

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPChaos
metadata:
  name: test-http-chaos
spec:
  mode: all
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      app: nginx
  target: Request
  port: 80
  method: GET
  path: /api/*
  delay: 10s
  replace:
    path: /api/v2/
    method: DELETE
  patch:
    headers:
      - ['Token', '<one token>']
      - ['Token', '<another token>']
    body:
      type: JSON
      value: '{"foo": "bar"}'
  duration: 5m
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 10m'
```

Based on this configuration example, Chaos Mesh will inject the `delay` fault, `replace` fault, and `patch` fault consecutively.

2. After the configuration file is prepared, use `kubectl` to create the experiment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./http-failure.yaml
```

## Local debugging

If you are not sure of the effects of certain fault injections, you can also test the corresponding features locally using [rs-tproxy](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/rs-tproxy). Chaos Mesh also provides HTTPChaos by using rs-tproxy.
