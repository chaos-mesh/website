title: Status Check in Workflow
---

In `Workflow`, status check could execute specified operations to external systems (such as application systems, monitoring systems) to obtain the status of the external system, and can automatically abort the `Workflow` when it is detected that the system is unhealthy. The concept is similar to `Container Probes` in Kubernetes. This article describes how to execute status checks in `Workflow` using yaml.

:::note

Chaos Mesh does not yet support to create `StatusCheck` nodes on Chaos Dashboard, so you could only create `StatusCheck` nodes using yaml for now. 

:::

## Status Check Type

Chaos Mesh only support `HTTP` type to execute status check.

### Define a `HTTP` StatusCheck node

`StatusCheck` Nodes could send GET or POST HTTP requests to the specific URL, with custom request headers and request body, and then determine the result of the request by the conditions in the `criteria` field.

```yaml
- name: workflow-status-check
  templateType: StatusCheck
  deadline: 20s
  statusCheck:
    mode: Continuous
    type: HTTP
    intervalSeconds: 1
    timeoutSeconds: 1
    http:
      url: http://123.123.123.123
      method: GET
      criteria:
        statusCode: "200"
```

In the configuration, you can see that the `StatusCheck` node with `HTTP` type. The `deadline` field specifies that this node could be executed for a maximum of 20 seconds. The `mode` field specifies that this node will execute status checks continuously. The `intervalSeconds` field specifies a repetition interval of 1 second. The `timeoutSeconds` field specifies the timeout for each execution.

When `Workflow` runs to this `StatusCheck` node, the specified status check would be executed every 1 second. The status check uses the GET method to send a HTTP request to the URL `http://123.123.123.123`, if the response is returned within 1 second and the status code is 200, this exeuction succeeds, otherwise it fails.

## Status Check Result

Each execution of status check will get an `execution result`, either `Success` or `Failure`. Because a single `execution result` may not reflect the real situation of the system, due to fluctuations in certain conditions, the final `status check result` is not determined based on a single `execution result`.

The `StatusCheck` node has `failureThreshold` and `successThreshold` two fields:

- When the number of consecutive failed `execution results` exceeds the `failureThreshold`, the `status check result` is considered to be a failure.
- When the number of consecutive successful `execution results` exceeds the `successThreshold`, the `status check result` is considered to be a success.

```yaml
- name: workflow-status-check
  templateType: StatusCheck
  deadline: 20s
  statusCheck:
    mode: Continuous
    type: HTTP
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 3
    http:
      url: http://123.123.123.123
      method: GET
      criteria:
        statusCode: "200"
```

In the configuration, the `StatusCheck` node will execute status checks continuously:

- When the `execution result` is `Success` for 1 or more consecutive times, the `status check result` is considered to be a `Success`.
- When the `execution result` is `Failure` for 3 or more consecutive times, the `status check result` is considered to be a `Failure`.

:::note

When referring to `status check fails`, it refers to `status check result` is `Failure`, rather than a single `execution result` is `Failure`.

:::

### When the status check is unsuccessful, abort the workflow

:::note

The `StatusCheck` node only support that when the status check is unsuccessful, abort the workflow automatically. It could not pause the workflow, or resume the workflow.

:::

When exeucting chaos experiments, the application system may become `unhealthy`, this function can be used to restore the application system by quickly ending chaos experiments. Setting the `abortWithStatusCheck` field to `true` on the `StatusCheck` node will automatically abort the workflow when the status check fails.

```yaml
- name: workflow-status-check
  templateType: StatusCheck
  deadline: 20s
  abortWithStatusCheck: true
  statusCheck:
    mode: Continuous
    type: HTTP
    http:
      url: http://123.123.123.123
      method: GET
      criteria:
        statusCode: "200"
```

The status check is considered unsuccessful when any of the following conditions are met:

- The status check fails
- When the `StatusCheck` node timeout is exceeded, and the `status check result` is not successful. For example, `successThreshold` is 1, `failureThreshold` is 3, and when the timeout is exceeded, there are 2 consecutive failures and 0 successes. Although it does not meet the condition for `status check fails`, it's also considerd in this case, that the status check is unsuccessful.

## Status Check Mode

### Continuous Status Check

When the `mode` field is `Continuous`, it means this `StatusCheck` node will execute status checks continuously, until the node times out or the status check fails.

```yaml
- name: workflow-status-check
  templateType: StatusCheck
  deadline: 20s
  statusCheck:
    mode: Continuous
    type: HTTP
    intervalSeconds: 1
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 3
    http:
      url: http://123.123.123.123
      method: GET
      criteria:
        statusCode: "200"
```

In the configuration, the `StatusCheck` node will execute status checks every 1 second, and exit when any of the following conditions are met:

- The status check fails, i.e. 3 or more consecutive failed `execution results`
- Trigger the node timeout after 20 seconds

### One shot Status Check

When the `mode` field is `Synchronous`, it means that this `StatusCheck` node will exit immediately when the `status check result` is clear, or when the node times out.

```yaml
- name: workflow-status-check
  templateType: StatusCheck
  deadline: 20s
  statusCheck:
    mode: Synchronous
    type: HTTP
    intervalSeconds: 1
    successThreshold: 1
    failureThreshold: 3
    http:
      url: http://123.123.123.123
      method: GET
      criteria:
        statusCode: "200"
```

In the configuration, the `StatusCheck` node will execute status checks every 1 second, and exit when any of the following conditions are met:

- The status check succeeds, i.e. 1 or more consecutive successful `execution results`
- The status check fails, i.e. 3 or more consecutive failed `execution results`
- Trigger the node timeout after 20 seconds

## Status Check vs HTTP Request Task

Similarities:

- The `StatusCheck` node and the `HTTP Request Task` node (the `Task` node that executes HTTP requests) are a node type of `Workflow`
- The `StatusCheck` node and the `HTTP Request Task` node can obtain information about external systems through HTTP requests

Differences:

- The `HTTP Request Task` node could only send a HTTP once, and cannot send HTTP requests continuously
- The `HTTP Request Task` node cannot affect the status of the workflow when the request fails (such as aborting the workflow)
