title: Status Check in Workflow
---

In `Workflow`, status check could execute specified operations to external systems (such as application systems, monitoring systems) to obtain the status of the external system, and can automatically abort the `Workflow` when it is detected that the system is unhealthy. The concept is similar to `Container Probes` in Kubernetes. This article describes how to execute status checks in `Workflow` using yaml.

:::note

Chaos Mesh does not yet support to create `StatusCheck` nodes on Chaos Dashboard, so you could only create `StatusCheck` nodes using yaml for now. 

:::

## Status Check Type

Chaos Mesh only support `HTTP` type to execute status check.

### Define a `HTTP` StatusCheck node

// TODO

## Status Check Result

## Status Check Mode


## Status Check vs HTTP Request Task


## Field description

The describe about Workflow and Template could refer to [Create Chaos Mesh Workflow](create-chaos-mesh-workflow.md#field-description)ã€‚

| successThreshold | int | The minimum consecutive successes for the status check to be considered successful. | `1` | No | `1` |
| recordsHistoryLimit | int | The number of record to retain. | 100 | No | `100` |

### HTTPCriteria field description

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default value | Required | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| statusCode | string | The expected http status code for the request. A statusCode string could be a single code (e.g. `200`), or an inclusive range (e.g. `200-400`, both `200` and `400` are included). | None | Yes | `200` |
