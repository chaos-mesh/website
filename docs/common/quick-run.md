After verifying that the installation is complete, you can run a Chaos experiment to experience the features of Chaos Mesh.

For the method to run the experiment, it is recommended to refer to [Run a Chaos experiment](run-a-chaos-experiment.md). After successfully creating the experiment, you can observe the running status of the experiment on the Chaos Dashboard.
