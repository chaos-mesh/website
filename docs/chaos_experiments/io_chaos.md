This document walks you through the IOChaos experiment.

IOChaos allows you to simulate file system faults such as IO delay and read/write errors. It can inject delay and fault when your program is running IO system calls such as `open`, `read`, and `write`.

## Configuration file

Below is a sample YAML file of IOChaos:

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: IoChaos
metadata:
  name: io-delay-example
spec:
  action: latency
  mode: one
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      app: etcd
  volumePath: /var/run/etcd
  path: '/var/run/etcd/**/*'
  delay: '100ms'
  percent: 50
  duration: '400s'
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 10m'
```

For more sample files, see [examples](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/tree/master/examples). You can edit them as needed.

## Usage

Assume that you are using `examples/io-mixed-example.yaml`, you can run the following command to create a chaos experiment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/io-mixed-example.yaml
```

## IOChaos available actions

IOChaos currently supports the following actions:

- **latency**: IO latency action. You can specify the latency before the IO operation returns a result.
- **fault**: IO fault action. In this mode, IO operations returns an error.
- **attrOverride**: Override attributes of a file.

### latency

If you are using the `latency` action, you can edit the specification as below:

```yaml
spec:
  action: latency
  delay: '1ms'
```

It will inject a latency of 1ms into the selected methods.

### fault

If you are using the `fault` action, you can edit the specification as below:

```yaml
spec:
  action: fault
  errno: 32
```

The selected methods return error 32, which means `broken pipe`.

### attrOverride

If you are using the `attrOverride` mode, you can edit the specification as below:

```yaml
spec:
  action: attrOverride
  attr:
    perm: 72
```

Then the permission of selected files will be overridden with 110 in octal, which means the files cannot be read or modified (without CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE). See [available attributes](#available-attributes) for a list of all possible attributes to override.

> **Note**:
>
> Attributes could be cached by Linux kernel, so it might have no effect if your program had accessed it before.

## Common Linux system errors

Common Linux system errors are as below:

- `1`: Operation not permitted
- `2`: No such file or directory
- `5`: I/O error
- `6`: No such device or address
- `12`: Out of memory
- `16`: Device or resource busy
- `17`: File exists
- `20`: Not a directory
- `22`: Invalid argument
- `24`: Too many open files
- `28`: No space left on device

Refer to [related header files](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/torvalds/linux/master/include/uapi/asm-generic/errno-base.h) for more information.
