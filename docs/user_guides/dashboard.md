Chaos Dashboard is a one-stop web UI for managing, designing, and monitoring chaos experiments on Chaos Mesh. This document provides a step-by-step introduction on how to use Chaos Dashboard.

## Install Chaos Dashboard

You can install Chaos Mesh with Chaos Dashboard by executing the command below:

```bash
helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

If you have already installed Chaos Mesh, upgrade it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

### Security Mode

Dashboard supports the `security mode`, which required to login with a token. The token is generated by Kubernetes, and the user can only perform things within the scope of the token authority on the Dashboard.

The security mode is enabled by default if you install via Helm. You can disable it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.securityMode=false
```

**Note:**
>
> 1. The security mode can be turned off only in test scenarios, and it is strongly recommended to turn it on in other cases.
> 2. The security mode is disabled if you install Chaos Mesh by `install.sh`, which is suitable for trying Chaos Mesh out.

## Access Chaos Dashboard

A typical way to access Chaos Dashboard is to use `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n chaos-testing svc/chaos-dashboard 2333:2333
```

Now you should be able to access [`http://localhost:2333`](http://localhost:2333) in the browser.

## Use Dashboard

### Login

If the Dashboard is installed with security mode, you need to fill in `Name` and `Token` when you open Dashboard in the browser. Otherwise, you can skip this section.

The token is generated by Kubernetes, this section will introduce how to generate the token.

#### Create User

First, create the `Role`. Here are some examples of role configurations that you can choose one and adjust it to meet your specific requirement.

- Cluster Manager

    This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

    Sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    kind: ClusterRole
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: cluster-role-manager
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
    ```

- Cluster Viewer

    This role has permission to view chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster.

    Sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    kind: ClusterRole
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: cluster-role-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
    ```

- Namespace Manager

    This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

    The sample configuration file is as follows:

    ```yaml
    kind: Role
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      namespace: namespace-test
      name: role-test-manager
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
    ```

- Namespace Viewer

    This role has access to the chaos experiment under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.

    Sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    kind: Role
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      namespace: namespace-test
      name: role-test-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
    ```

Then create `ServiceAccount`, and bind the `ServiceAccount` with `Role`. Refer to [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for more details.

#### Get the Token

The token is generated by Kubernetes. To get a token for the `ServiceAccount` created above, refer to [getting-a-bearer-token](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md#getting-a-bearer-token).

#### Login With Name and Token

 The `Name` can be any string used to identify the `Token`, and a meaningful `Name` is suggested, such as `Cluster-Manager`, to indicate that the `Token` has permissions managed chaos experiments in the cluster.
