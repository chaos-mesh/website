Chaos Dashboard is a one-step web UI for managing, designing, and monitoring chaos experiments on Chaos Mesh. This document provides a step-by-step introduction on how to use Chaos Dashboard.

## Install Chaos Dashboard

Chaos Dashboard is installed by default after v1.2.0. You can run the following command to check the status of Chaos Dashboard Pod:

```bash
# chaos-testing: the default namespace for installing Chaos Mesh
kubectl get pod -n chaos-testing -l app.kubernetes.io/component=chaos-dashboard
```

Expected output:

```bash
chaos-dashboard-b8767fbcd-46cnd   1/1     Running   0          31m
```

If you don't get the Chaos Dashboard pod, you can add it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

## Enable/Disable security mode

Chaos Dashboard supports a security mode, which requires users to login with a token generated by Kubernetes. Each token is linked to a `service account`. You can only perform operations within the scope as allowed by the role that is associated with the service account.

The security mode is enabled by default if you install via Helm. You can disable it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.securityMode=false
```

**Note:**

> - For actual testing scenarios, we strongly recommend that you enable the security mode.
> - The security mode is disabled if you install Chaos Mesh by `install.sh`, which is suitable for trying Chaos Mesh out.

## Access Chaos Dashboard

A typical way to access Chaos Dashboard is to use `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n chaos-testing svc/chaos-dashboard 2333:2333
```

Now you should be able to access [`http://localhost:2333`](http://localhost:2333) in the browser.

## Log In

By default, the security mode is enabled when using helm to install Chaos Mesh, and you will need to log in Chaos Dashboard with an account `Name` and `Token`. This section introduces how to create the account and the token. You can skip this step if you have disabled the security mode.

### Create the account

Chaos Dashboard supports Role-Based Access Control ([RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)).

**Note:**

> - If you want to create the account later and start using Chaos Dashboard quickly, you can use the token of Chaos Mesh. Get the token by executing the command: `kubectl -n chaos-testing describe secret $(kubectl -n chaos-testing get secret | grep chaos-controller-manager | awk '{print $1}')`, and then you can go to [Fill in](#fill-in) directly.

To create the account:

1. Create the `Role`. Here are sample role configurations that you can choose from and edit to meet your specific requirement. You need to save the configuration to an YAML file, and then use `kubectl apply -f {YAML-File}` to create it.

   - **Cluster Manager**

     This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: ClusterRole
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: cluster-role-manager
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
           - create
           - update
           - patch
           - delete
     ```

   - **Cluster Viewer**

     This role has permission to view chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: ClusterRole
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: cluster-role-viewer
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
     ```

   - **Namespace Manager**

     This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

     The sample configuration file is as follows:

     ```yaml
     kind: Role
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: namespace-test-role-manager
       namespace: test
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
           - create
           - update
           - patch
           - delete
     ```

   - **Namespace Viewer**

     This role has access to the chaos experiment under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: Role
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: namespace-test-role-viewer
       namespace: test
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
     ```

2. Create a `ServiceAccount`, and bind it with a specific `Role`. Refer to [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for more details. Here are sample configurations that you can choose from and edit to meet your specific requirement. You need to save the configuration to an YAML file, and then use `kubectl apply -f {YAML-File}` to create it.

   - **Create a ServiceAccount and bind cluster role**

     Create a ServiceAccount and bind it with the role `Cluster Manager` or `Cluster Viewer`.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: ServiceAccount
     apiVersion: v1
     metadata:
       name: account-cluster-manager # use "account-cluster-viewer" for viewer
       namespace: chaos-testing

     ---
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: ClusterRoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: bind-cluster-manager # use "bind-cluster-viewer" for viewer
     subjects:
       - kind: ServiceAccount
         name: account-cluster-manager # use "account-cluster-viewer" for viewer
         namespace: chaos-testing
     roleRef:
       kind: ClusterRole
       name: cluster-role-manager # use "cluster-role-viewer" for viewer
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     ```

   - **Create a ServiceAccount and bind namespace role**

     Create a ServiceAccount and bind it with the role `Namespace Manager` or `Namespace Viewer`.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: ServiceAccount
     apiVersion: v1
     metadata:
       name: account-namespace-test-manager # use "account-namespace-test-viewer" for viewer
       namespace: test

     ---
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     kind: RoleBinding
     metadata:
       name: bind-namespace-test-manager # use "bind-namespace-test-viewer" for viewer
       namespace: test
     subjects:
       - kind: ServiceAccount
         name: account-namespace-test-manager # use "account-namespace-test-viewer" for viewer
         namespace: test
     roleRef:
       kind: Role
       name: namespace-test-role-manager # use "namespace-test-role-viewer" for viewer
       apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
     ```

### Get the token

The token is generated by Kubernetes. To get a token for the `ServiceAccount` created above, run command below:

```bash
kubectl -n ${namespace} describe secret $(kubectl -n ${namespace} get secret | grep ${service-account-name} | awk '{print $1}')
```

**Note:**

> - You need to replace the `${namespace}` and `${service-account-name}` with the actual value. For example, executing command `kubectl -n chaos-testing describe secret $(kubectl -n chaos-testing get secret | grep cluster-role-manager | awk '{print $1}')` to get the token of `cluster-role-manager`.

Refer to [getting-a-bearer-token](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md#getting-a-bearer-token) for more details.

### Fill in

With the token generated, you need to identify it with a `Name`. A meaningful name is recommended, for example, `Cluster-Manager`, to indicate that the token has permissions managed chaos experiments in the cluster.

Fill in the form with `Name` and `Token`:
