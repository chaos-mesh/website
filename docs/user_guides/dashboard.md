Chaos Dashboard is a one-stop web UI for managing, designing, and monitoring chaos experiments on Chaos Mesh. This document provides a step-by-step introduction on how to use Chaos Dashboard.

## Install Chaos Dashboard

You can install Chaos Mesh with Chaos Dashboard by executing the command below:

```bash
helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

If you have already installed Chaos Mesh, upgrade it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

## Enable/Disable security mode

Chaos Dashboard supports a security mode, which requires users to login with a token generated by Kubernetes. Each token is linked to a `service account`. You can only perform operations within the scope as allowed by the role that is associated with the service account.

The security mode is enabled by default if you install via Helm. You can disable it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.securityMode=false
```

**Note:**
>
> - For actual testing scenarios, we strongly recommend that you enable the security mode.
> - The security mode is disabled if you install Chaos Mesh by `install.sh`, which is suitable for trying Chaos Mesh out.

## Access Chaos Dashboard

A typical way to access Chaos Dashboard is to use `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n chaos-testing svc/chaos-dashboard 2333:2333
```

Now you should be able to access [`http://localhost:2333`](http://localhost:2333) in the browser.


## Log In

By default, the security mode is enabled when using helm to install Chaos Mesh, and you will need to log in Chaos Dashboard with an account `Name` and `Token`. This section introduces how to create the account and the token. You can skip this step if you have disabled the security mode.

### Create the account

Chaos Dashboard supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). To create the account:

1. Create the `Role`. Here are sample role configurations that you can choose from and edit to meet your specific requirement.

  - Cluster Manager

    This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

    Sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    kind: ClusterRole
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: cluster-role-manager
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
    ```

  - Cluster Viewer

    This role has permission to view chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster.

    Sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    kind: ClusterRole
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: cluster-role-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
    ```

  - Namespace Manager

    This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

    The sample configuration file is as follows:

    ```yaml
    kind: Role
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      namespace: namespace-test
      name: role-test-manager
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - create
      - delete
      - get
      - list
      - patch
      - update
      - watch
    ```

  - Namespace Viewer

    This role has access to the chaos experiment under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.

    Sample configuration file:

    ```yaml
    kind: Role
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    metadata:
      namespace: namespace-test
      name: role-test-reader
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "namespaces"]
      verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
    - apiGroups:
      - chaos-mesh.org
      resources: [ "*" ]
      verbs:
      - get
      - list
      - watch
    ```

2. Create a `ServiceAccount`, and bind it with a specific `Role`. Refer to [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for more details.

### Get the token

The token is generated by Kubernetes. To get a token for the `ServiceAccount` created above, run command below:

```bash
kubectl -n ${namespace} describe secret $(kubectl -n ${namespace} get secret | grep ${service-account-name} | awk '{print $1}')
```

Refer to [getting-a-bearer-token](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md#getting-a-bearer-token) for more details.

### Sign in

With the token generated, you need to identify it with a `Name`. A meaningful name is recommended, for example, `Cluster-Manager`, to indicate that the token has permissions managed chaos experiments in the cluster.

Sign in Chaos Dashboard with `Name` and `Token`:
