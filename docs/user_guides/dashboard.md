Chaos Dashboard is a one-step web UI for managing, designing, and monitoring chaos experiments on Chaos Mesh. This document provides a step-by-step introduction on how to use Chaos Dashboard.

## Install Chaos Dashboard

You can install Chaos Mesh with Chaos Dashboard by executing the command below:

```bash
helm install chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

If you have already installed Chaos Mesh, upgrade it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.create=true
```

## Enable/Disable security mode

Chaos Dashboard supports a security mode, which requires users to login with a token generated by Kubernetes. Each token is linked to a `service account`. You can only perform operations within the scope as allowed by the role that is associated with the service account.

The security mode is enabled by default if you install via Helm. You can disable it by executing:

```bash
helm upgrade chaos-mesh chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh --namespace=chaos-testing --set dashboard.securityMode=false
```

**Note:**

> - For actual testing scenarios, we strongly recommend that you enable the security mode.
> - The security mode is disabled if you install Chaos Mesh by `install.sh`, which is suitable for trying Chaos Mesh out.

## Access Chaos Dashboard

A typical way to access Chaos Dashboard is to use `kubectl port-forward`:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n chaos-testing svc/chaos-dashboard 2333:2333
```

Now you should be able to access [`http://localhost:2333`](http://localhost:2333) in the browser.

## Log In

By default, the security mode is enabled when using helm to install Chaos Mesh, and you will need to log in Chaos Dashboard with an account `Name` and `Token`. This section introduces how to create the account and the token. You can skip this step if you have disabled the security mode.

### Create the account

Chaos Dashboard supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). To create the account:

1. Create the `Role`. Here are sample role configurations that you can choose from and edit to meet your specific requirement.

   - **Cluster Manager**

     This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: ClusterRole
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: cluster-role-manager
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
           - create
           - update
           - patch
           - delete
     ```

   - **Cluster Viewer**

     This role has permission to view chaos experiments under all namespaces in the Kubernetes cluster.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: ClusterRole
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: cluster-role-reader
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
     ```

   - **Namespace Manager**

     This role has administrative permissions on chaos experiments under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster, including creating, updating, archiving, and viewing chaos experiments.

     The sample configuration file is as follows:

     ```yaml
     kind: Role
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: namespace-test-role-manager
       namespace: test
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
           - create
           - update
           - patch
           - delete
     ```

   - Namespace Viewer

     This role has access to the chaos experiment under a specified namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.

     Sample configuration file:

     ```yaml
     kind: Role
     apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
     metadata:
       name: namespace-test-role-reader
       namespace: test
     rules:
       - apiGroups: ['']
         resources: ['pods', 'namespaces']
         verbs: ['get', 'list', 'watch']
       - apiGroups:
           - chaos-mesh.org
         resources: ['*']
         verbs:
           - get
           - list
           - watch
     ```

2. Create a `ServiceAccount`, and bind it with a specific `Role`. Refer to [RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/zh/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) for more details.

### Get the token

The token is generated by Kubernetes. To get a token for the `ServiceAccount` created above, run command below:

```bash
kubectl -n ${namespace} describe secret $(kubectl -n ${namespace} get secret | grep ${service-account-name} | awk '{print $1}')
```

Refer to [getting-a-bearer-token](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/blob/master/docs/user/access-control/creating-sample-user.md#getting-a-bearer-token) for more details.

### Fill in

With the token generated, you need to identify it with a `Name`. A meaningful name is recommended, for example, `Cluster-Manager`, to indicate that the token has permissions managed chaos experiments in the cluster.

Fill in the form with `Name` and `Token`:

## Create a chaos experiment

To create a chaos experiment on Chaos Dashboard:

1. Click the **NEW EXPERIMENT** button to create a new chaos experiment:

   ![dashboard-new-experiment](/img/user_guides/dashboard-new-exp.png)

2. Configure the chaos experiment, including the experiment type, name, scheduling information, etc.

## Manage a chaos experiment

To manage a specific chaos experiment:

1. Click the **Experiments** button to view all the chaos experiments.

   ![dashboard-experiments](/img/user_guides/dashboard-experiments.png)

## Homepage

To observe all chaos status, enter the homepage:

![dashboard-home](/img/user_guides/dashboard-home.png)

Through the steps just now, you already know how to create an experiment and view its detail. But this is only one of the main features of the dashboard.

Next, you can click the **TUTORIAL** button on the page to learn about all the features of the dashboard.

## Settings
