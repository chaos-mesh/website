title: Simulate File I/O Faults
---

This document describes how to create IOChaos experiments in Chaos Mesh.

## IOChaos introduction

IOChaos is a type of fault in Chaos Mesh. By creating an IOChaos experiment, you can simulate a scenario of file system fault. Currently, IOChaos supports the following fault types:

- `latency`: delays file system calls
- `fault`: returns an error for filesystem calls
- `attrOverride`: modifies file properties
- `mistake`: makes the file read or write a wrong value

For specific features, refer to [Create experiments using the YAML files](#create-experiments-using-the-yaml-files).

## Notes

1. Before creating an IOChaos experiment, make sure there is no Control Manager of Chaos Mesh running on the target Pod.

2. IOChaos may damage your data. Use IOChaos **with caution** in the production environment.

## Create experiments using Chaos Dashboard

1. Open Chaos Dashboard, and click **NEW EXPERIMENT** on the page to create a new experiment:

   ![Create a New Experiment](./img/create-new-exp.png)

2. In the **Choose a Target** area, choose **FILE SYSTEM INJECTION** and select a specific fault type, such as **LATENCY**.

   ![ioChaos Experiments](./img/iochaos-exp.png)

3. Fill out the experiment information, and specify the experiment scope and the scheduled experiment duration.

   ![Experiment Information](./img/exp-info.png)

4. Submit the experiment information.

## Create experiments using the YAML files

### Latency example

1. Write the experiment configuration to the `io-latency.yaml` file, as shown below:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
   kind: IOChaos
   metadata:
     name: io-latency-example
     namespace: chaos-mesh
   spec:
     action: latency
     mode: one
     selector:
       labelSelectors:
         app: etcd
     volumePath: /var/run/etcd
     path: '/var/run/etcd/**/*'
     delay: '100ms'
     percent: 50
     duration: '400s'
   ```

   In this configuration example, Chaos Mesh injects a delay into the directory `/var/run/etcd` and causes latency of 100 milliseconds to all file system operations (including read, writing, list contents, and so on) in this directory.

2. After the configuration file is prepared, use `kubectl` to create an experiment:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./io-latency.yaml
   ```

### Fault example

1. Write the experiment configuration to the `io-fault.yaml` file, as shown below:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
   kind: IOChaos
   metadata:
     name: io-fault-example
     namespace: chaos-mesh
   spec:
     action: fault
     mode: one
     selector:
       labelSelectors:
         app: etcd
     volumePath: /var/run/etcd
     path: /var/run/etcd/**/*
     errno: 5
     percent: 50
     duration: '400s'
   ```

   In this example, Chaos Mesh injects a file fault into the directory `/var/run/etcd`, which gives a 50% probability of failure in all file system operations under this directory and returns error code 5 (Input/output error).

2. After the configuration file is prepared, use `kubectl` to create an experiment:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./io-fault.yaml
   ```

### attrOverride example

1. Write the experiment configuration to the `io-attr.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
   kind: IOChaos
   metadata:
     name: io-attr-example
     namespace: chaos-mesh
   spec:
     action: attrOverride
     mode: one
     selector:
       labelSelectors:
         app: etcd
     volumePath: /var/run/etcd
     path: /var/run/etcd/**/*
     attr:
       perm: 72
     percent: 10
     duration: '400s'
   ```

   In this configuration example, Chaos Mesh injects `/var/run/etcd` directories `attrOverride` fault, giving a 10% probability that all file system operations in this directory will change the target file permissions to 72 (110 in octal), which will allow files to be executed only by the owner and their group and not authorized to perform other actions.

2. After the configuration file is prepared, use `kubectl` to create an experiment:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./io-attr.yaml
   ```

### Mistake example

1. Write the experiment configuration to the `io-mistake.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
   kind: IOChaos
   metadata:
     name: io-mistake-example
     namespace: chaos-mesh
   spec:
     action: mistake
     mode: one
     selector:
       labelSelectors:
         app: etcd
     volumePath: /var/run/etcd
     path: /var/run/etcd/**/*
     mistake:
       filling: zero
       maxOccurrences: 1
       maxLength: 10
     methods:
       - READ
       - WRITE
     percent: 10
     duration: '400s'
   ```

   In this configuration example, Chaos Mesh injects read and write faults into the directory `/var/run/etcd`, which gives a 10% probability of failure in the read and write operations under this directory. During this process, one random position with a maximum length of 10 bytes will be replaced with 0 bytes.

2. After the configuration file is prepared, use `kubectl` to create an experiment:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f ./io-mistake.yaml
   ```

::warning It is suggested that you only use mistake on READ and WRITE file system calls. Using mistake on other file system calls may lead to unexpected consequences, including but not limited to file system damage and program crashes. :::

## Local debugging

If you are not sure about the effect of a certain Chaos, you can use [toda](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda) to test the feature locally. Chaos Mesh also uses toda to implement IOChaos.
