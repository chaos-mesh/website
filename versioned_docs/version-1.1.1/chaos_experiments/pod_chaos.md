This document introduces how to create PodChaos experiments.

> **Note:**
>
> Currently, Chaos Mesh does not support simulation injection of naked pods. And it only supports some specific pods, such as `deployment`, `statefulset`, `daemonset`.

PodChaos allows you to simulate pod faults or specific container issue, specifically `pod failure`, `pod kill` and `container kill`. `pod failure` can be used to simulate a situation where a pod is down. In this case, the pod is unavailable for a long time.

- **Pod Failure** action periodically injects errors to pods. And it will cause pod creation failure for a while. In other words, the selected pod will be unavailable in a specified period.

- **Pod Kill** action kills the specified pod (ReplicaSet or something similar might be needed to ensure the pod will be restarted).

- **Container Kill** action kills the specified container in the target pods.

## `pod-failure` configuration file

Below is a sample `pod-failure` configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-failure-example
  namespace: chaos-testing
spec:
  action: pod-failure
  mode: one
  value: ''
  duration: '30s'
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      'app.kubernetes.io/component': 'tikv'
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 2m'
```

For more sample files, see [examples](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/tree/master/examples). You can edit them as needed.

For a detailed description of each field in the configuration template, see [`Field description`](#fields-description).

## `pod-kill` configuration file

Below is a sample `pod-kill` configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: pod-kill-example
  namespace: chaos-testing
spec:
  action: pod-kill
  mode: one
  selector:
    namespaces:
      - tidb-cluster-demo
    labelSelectors:
      'app.kubernetes.io/component': 'tikv'
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 1m'
```

For a detailed description of each field in the configuration template, see [`Field description`](#fields-description).

## `container-kill` configuration file

Below is a sample `container-kill` configuration file:

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: PodChaos
metadata:
  name: container-kill-example
  namespace: chaos-testing
spec:
  action: container-kill
  mode: one
  containerName: 'prometheus'
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      'app.kubernetes.io/component': 'monitor'
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 30s'
```

For a detailed description of each field in the configuration template, see [`Field description`](#fields-description).

## Fields description

- **action** defines the specific chaos action for the Pod. In this case, it is a Pod failure.
- **mode** defines the mode to run chaos action. Supported mode: `one` / `all` / `fixed` / `fixed-percent` / `random-max-percent`.
- **value** depends on the value of `mode`. If `mode` is `one` or `all`, leave `value` empty. If `fixed`, provide an integer of pods to do chaos action. If `fixed-percent`, provide a number from 0 to 100 to specify the percent of pods the server can do chaos action. If `random-max-percent`, provide a number from 0 to 100 to specify the max percent of pods to do chaos action.
- **selector** specifies the target pods for chaos injections. For more details, see [Define the Scope of Chaos Experiment](../user_guides/experiment_scope.md).
- **containerName** defines the target container name, it is needed by container kill action.
- **gracePeriod** defines the duration in seconds before the pod should be deleted. It is used in pod-kill action, and its value must be non-negative integer. The default value is zero that indicates delete immediately.
- **duration** defines the duration for each chaos experiment. The default value is `30s`, which indicates that pod failure will last for 30 seconds.
- **scheduler** defines the scheduler rules for the running time of the chaos experiment. For more rule information, see [robfig/cron](https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron).
