Welcome to the Chaos Mesh documentation!

Chaos Mesh is a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos on Kubernetes environments. At the current stage, it has the following components:

- **Chaos Operator**: the core component for chaos orchestration. Fully open-sourced.
- **Chaos Dashboard**: a Web UI for managing, designing, monitoring Chaos Experiments; under development.

Chaos Mesh is a versatile chaos engineering solution that features all-around fault injection methods for complex systems on Kubernetes, covering faults in Pod, network, file system, and even the kernel.
