This document helps you build IOChaos experiments.

IOChaos allows you to simulate file system faults such as IO delay and read/write errors. It can inject delay and errno when you use IO system calls such as `open`, `read` and `write`.

> **Note:**
>
> IOChaos can only be used if the relevant labels and annotations are set before the application is created. See [Create a chaos experiment](#create-a-chaos-experiment) for more information.

## Prerequisites

### Commands and arguments for the application container

Chaos Mesh uses [`wait-fush.sh`](./sidecar_template.md/#tips) to ensure that the fuse-daemon server is running normally before the application starts.

Therefore, `wait-fush.sh` needs to be injected into the startup command of the container. If the application process is not started by the [commands and arguments of the container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/), IOChaos cannot work properly.

> **Note:**
>
> When Kubernetes natively supports [Sidecar Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753) in future versions, we will remove the `wait-fush.sh` dependency.

### Admission controller

IOChaos needs to inject a sidecar container to user pods and the sidecar container can be added to applicable Kubernetes pods using a [mutating webhook admission controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/) provided by Chaos Mesh.

> **Note:**
>
> - While admission controllers are enabled by default, some Kubernetes distributions might disable them. In this case, follow the instructions to [turn on admission controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#how-do-i-turn-on-an-admission-controller).
> - [ValidatingAdmissionWebhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#validatingadmissionwebhook) and [MutatingAdmissionWebhooks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook) are required by IOChaos.

### Template Configuration

Chaos Mesh uses a template mechanism to simplify the configuration of sidecar injection.

Because of the `Go Template` conflict with `helm`, the common template is not included in the [helm chart](../installation/installation.md#install-by-helm).
However, it will be deployed automatically if you install Chaos Mesh via the [install script](../installation/installation.md#install-chaos-mesh).

By default, the common template ConfigMaps should be deployed in the same namespace as Chaos Mesh.

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/chaosfs-sidecar.yaml -n <Chaos Mesh namespace>
```

### Data directory

The data directory of the application in the target pod should be a **subdirectory** of `PersistentVolumes`.

Example:

```yaml
# the config about tikv PersistentVolumes
volumeMounts:
  - name: datadir
    mountPath: /var/lib/tikv

# the arguments to start tikv
ARGS="--pd=${CLUSTER_NAME}-pd:2379 \
  --advertise-addr=${HOSTNAME}.${HEADLESS_SERVICE_NAME}.${NAMESPACE}.svc:20160 \
  --addr=0.0.0.0:20160 \
  --data-dir=/var/lib/tikv/data \  # data directory
  --capacity=${CAPACITY} \
  --config=/etc/tikv/tikv.toml
```

> **Note:**
>
> - The default data directory of TiKV is not a subdirectory of `PersistentVolumes`.
> - If you are testing a TiDB cluster, you need to modify it at [`_start_tikv.sh.tpl`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/charts/tidb-cluster/templates/scripts/_start_tikv.sh.tpl).
> - PD has the same issue with TiKV. You need to modify the data directory of PD at [`_start_pd.sh.tpl`](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-operator/blob/master/charts/tidb-cluster/templates/scripts/_start_pd.sh.tpl).

## Injection configuration

Injection configuration is another [ConfigMap](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/) and is required to fulfill IO Chaos.

To define a specified ConfigMap for your application before starting your chaos experiment, please refer to this [document](sidecar_configmap.md).

You can apply the ConfigMap defined for your application to Kubernetes cluster by the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f app-configmap.yaml # app-configmap.yaml is the ConfigMap file
```

## Configuration file

Below is a sample YAML file of IOChaos:

```yaml
apiVersion: chaos-mesh.org/v1alpha1
kind: IoChaos
metadata:
  name: io-delay-example
  namespace: chaos-testing
spec:
  action: mixed
  mode: one
  duration: '400s'
  path: ''
  selector:
    labelSelectors:
      'app.kubernetes.io/component': 'tikv'
  layer: 'fs'
  percent: '50'
  delay: '1ms'
  scheduler:
    cron: '@every 10m'
```

For more sample files, see [examples](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/tree/master/examples). You can edit them as needed.

| **duration** | Represents the duration of a chaos action. The duration might be a string with the signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | `"300ms"`/ `"-1.5h"` / `"2h45m"`                                                  |
| **delay**    | Defines the value of IOChaos action delay. The duration might be a string with the signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", and "h". If `Delay` is empty, the operator will generate a value for it randomly.                                                                                                                      | `"300ms"`/ `"-1.5h"` / `"2h45m"`                                                  |
| **errno**    | Defines the error code that is returned by an IO action. This value and the [errno defined by Linux system](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/errno.3.html) are consistent. This field needs to be set when you choose an `errno` or `mixed` action. If `errno` is empty, the operator randomly generates an error code for it. See the [common Linux system errors](#common-linux-system-errors) for more Linux system error codes. | `"2"`                                                                             |

| **path**     | Defines the path of files for injecting IOChaos actions. It should be a regular expression for the path which you want to inject errno or delay. If the path is `""` or not defined, the IOChaos action is injected into all files.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                   |

| **layer**    | Represents the layer of the IO action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | `fs` (by default).                                                                |

## Usage

Before the application created, you need to enable admission-webhook enabled on the application namespace:

```bash
kubectl create ns app-ns
kubectl label ns app-ns admission-webhook=enabled
```

Then we have two ways to mark the pods we want to inject IO Chaos:

1. Set annotation `admission-webhook.chaos-mesh.org/init-request` on the namespace, then all pods in this namespace meet the selector requirements will be injected.

```bash
# set annotation
kubectl annotate ns app-ns admission-webhook.chaos-mesh.org/init-request=chaosfs-tikv

# create your application
...
```

2. Set annotation `admission-webhook.chaos-mesh.org/request` on the pods, you can check this [example](https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/blob/master/examples/etcd/etcd.yaml).

Then, you can start your application and define YAML file to start your chaos experiment.

> **Note**:
>
> The value of the annotation in the above examples, `chaos-tikv` is the name field in your injection config.

### Start a chaos experiment

Assume that you are using `examples/io-mixed-example.yaml`, you can run the following command to create a chaos experiment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/io-mixed-example.yaml
```

## IOChaos available actions

IOChaos currently supports the following actions:

- **delay**: IO delay action. You can specify the latency before the IO operation returns a result.
- **errno**: IO errno action. In this mode, read/write IO operations returns an error.
- **mixed**: Both **delay** and **errno** actions.

### delay

If you are using the delay mode, you can edit spec as below:

```yaml
spec:
  action: delay
  delay: '1ms'
```

If `delay` is not specified, it is generated randomly on runtime.

### errno

If you are using the errno mode, you can edit spec as below:

```yaml
spec:
  action: errno
  errno: '32'
```

If `errno` is not specified, it is generated randomly on runtime.

### mixed

If you are using the mixed mode, you can edit spec as below:

```yaml
spec:
  action: mixed
  delay: '1ms'
  errno: '32'
```

The mix mode defines the **delay** and **errno** actions in one spec.

## Common Linux system errors

Common Linux system errors are as below:

- `1`: Operation not permitted
- `2`: No such file or directory
- `5`: I/O error
- `6`: No such device or address
- `12`: Out of memory
- `16`: Device or resource busy
- `17`: File exists
- `20`: Not a directory
- `22`: Invalid argument
- `24`: Too many open files
- `28`: No space left on device
