On September 25, 2020, Chaos Mesh v1.0 is now released! We have made some significant improvements in this release, including the refactor of IoChaos, providing more security guarantees for chaos experiments, supporting the setting of protected Namespaces, and supporting the use of Namespaceâ€™s permissions. In addition, this release is also focused on Chaos Dashboard and Chaos Operator components, which helps users create more stable, safe, and controllable chaos experiments.
